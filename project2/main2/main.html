        <strong style="font-size: 25px;">The Growing Threat of Space Junk <br>Around the Moon</strong>
        <br><br>
        As lunar exploration gains momentum, space debris near the Moon is becoming an urgent concern. In the 1960s, the Moon’s vicinity was relatively clear, with only a few mission-related objects in orbit or on its surface. Fast forward to today, and the number of human-made objects near the Moon has increased dramatically, including orbiters, landers, and mission remnants. This growing clutter poses significant challenges for future lunar missions.
        <br><br><br>
        <strong style="font-size: 25px;">Why Lunar Space Debris Matters</strong>
        <br><br>
        Space junk around the Moon often goes untracked, creating unpredictable hazards that can interfere with spacecraft approaching or leaving lunar orbit, significantly increasing the risk of collisions. For missions like NASA’s Artemis program, these risks pose a serious threat to both equipment and astronaut safety. This debris isn’t just a navigation challenge—it represents a broader obstacle to humanity’s ability to explore and sustain operations in space. As we enter a new era of lunar exploration, addressing this growing issue is vital to ensuring safe passage and the success of future missions.
