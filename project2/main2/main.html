        <strong style="font-size: 25px;">The Growing Threat of Space Junk Around the Moon</strong>
        <br><br>
        As lunar exploration accelerates with programs like NASA's Artemis, the increasing presence of space debris near the Moon has become a pressing concern. In the 1960s, the Moon's orbit was relatively clear, with only a few mission-related objects. Today, it is cluttered with orbiters, landers, and mission remnants, creating unpredictable hazards for spacecraft. Untracked debris significantly raises the risk of collisions, endangering both equipment and astronaut safety. Beyond navigation challenges, this accumulation of junk threatens humanity's ability to sustain operations and explore space effectively. Addressing this issue is essential to ensure the success of future missions and safeguard our journey into a new era of lunar exploration.
