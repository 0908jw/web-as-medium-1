        <div class="body-text">
          Time travelers. They’re everywhere, everywhen. You just don’t see them. What if I told you that the very fabric of existence is being toyed with at every moment by inconsiderate time-traveling tourists?
          <br><br>
          Oh, sure, just grab your camera and hop into a time machine to snap photos of historical landmarks, or play pranks on notable figures like Stephen Hawking by skipping out on his fancy time travelers’ party. It’s all in good fun, right? But what about the consequences?
          <br><br>
          Even celebrities are in on the action, twisting the spacetime continuum into an infinite knot without a second thought. Who knows what ripple effects they’re causing?
          <br><br>
          Just the other day, I was tuned into an archived episode of Neil deGrasse Tyson’s podcast, Star Talk Radio. The topic? You guessed it—time travel. While I may not remember every detail, one peculiar claim stood out: Dr. Tyson mentioned a bizarre “rumor” he’d encountered, suggesting that the Titanic didn’t hit an iceberg at all.
          <br><br>
          What if, instead, the ship was the target of a time-traveling mishap? According to the theory, a group of time tourists may have interfered, causing the tragic fate of the Titanic to unfold in a way that was never intended. Imagine a scenario where well-meaning travelers, looking to witness history firsthand, accidentally altered the timeline, leading the ship into icy waters instead of safely navigating around them.
          <br><br>
          Supporters of this theory point to peculiar inconsistencies in historical accounts—eyewitness testimonies that seem to contradict the official narrative. Could there be traces of time travelers’ footprints hidden in the details? From sudden changes in weather patterns to unexplainable sightings of modern technology aboard the ship, skeptics and believers alike have begun to piece together a strange puzzle.
          <br><br>
          Furthermore, as more individuals dive into the world of conspiracy theories, the Titanic time travel narrative continues to gain traction. Social media is abuzz with discussions about the implications of time travel and its potential effects on our history. Is it possible that our understanding of the past has been shaped not only by those who lived it but by those who traveled back to witness—or perhaps interfere with—it?
          <br><br>
          As we reflect on the Titanic’s legacy, we must also consider the possibility that its story is not merely one of tragedy but of unforeseen consequences brought about by meddling time travelers. So, the next time you ponder the past, remember: the truth may be stranger than fiction, and the echoes of time could be reverberating through our history in ways we can’t yet comprehend.
          <br><br>
          So, what do you think? Are time travelers influencing our past? And if so, how much of our history is really our own?</div>
