    <h3><em>I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to advocate for an ongoing active engagement with the making of web pages and of web policies.</em></h3>
    <hr>
    <div>In <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dashes.com/anil/2012/12/the-web-we-lost.html">The Web We Lost (2012)</a>, Anil Dash writes: "In the early days of the social web, there was a broad expectation that regular people might own their own identities by having their own websites, instead of being dependent on a few big sites to host their online identity."</div>
    <div>In February 2015 the online journal QUARTZ published an article with the provocative headline: <a target="_blank" href="https://qz.com/333313/milliions-of-facebook-users-have-no-idea-theyre-using-the-internet">Millions of Facebook users have no idea they’re using the internet.</a> As the article states: "This is more than a matter of semantics. The expectations and behaviors of the next billion people to come online will have profound effects on how the internet evolves."</div>
    <br>
    <div>In October 2014 the online journal GIZMODO published an article heralding <a target="_blank" href="https://gizmodo.com/the-great-web-1-0-revival-1651487835">The Great Web 1.0 Revival</a>. Its author Kyle Chayka observed:
        <div><strong>The booming size of today's mainstream social networks and the constant level of noise we have to deal with has inspired a sudden return to a time when the internet was quieter, safer, and more intimate… We're nostalgic for the close-knit, DIY nature of the early web, where everything was smaller...</strong></div>
        The DIY aesthetics and practices of the mid-1990s have been embraced by the anti-social network <a target="_blank" href="http://tilde.club">TILDE.CLUB</a>, which hosts a small community of users on a single unix computer. For some, TILDE.CLUB serves as a platform for revisiting amateur web aesthetics in a contemporary context. For example, on her page, Olia Lialina invites users to view a new net art work <a target="_blank" href="http://tilde.club/~olialia/">640x480</a> - a 4-tab browser installation. For many others however, TILDE.CLUB has served as little more than a hip territory to occupy. Many pages remain blank.

        <br>
        <div>In other corners of the internet, Web 1.0 aesthetics have never disappeared. <a target="_blank" href="http://luckysoap.com">My own website</a>, including this page, which uses fixed-width table cells, is based on a template I created in HomeSite in 1997.</div>
        <br>
        <div>Web 1.0 aesthetics persist in source code and stated objectives of the massive <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ubuweb.com">Ubu Web site</a>, an "independent resource dedicated to all strains of the avant-garde, ethnopoetics, and outsider arts." On 16 December 2014, the founder of <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/ubuweb/status/545074372093165568">boasted on Twitter</a> that "the whole damn site is still hand-coded in html 1.0 in bbedit, from templates made in 1996."</div>
        <br>
        <div>I shall put off updating my website templates until out-of-date design is no longer cool.
