            The term 'handmade' usually refers to objects made by hand or by using simple tools rather
            than machines. The result may be homely — as in a child's clay ashtray — or exquisite — as in
            a pair of bespoke brogues.
            <div><h3><em>I evoke the term 'handmade web' to refer to web pages coded by hand rather than by software; web pages made and maintained by individuals rather than by businesses or corporations; web pages which are provisional, temporary, or one-of-a-kind; web pages which challenge conventions of reading, writing, design, ownership, privacy, security, or identity.</em></h3></div>
            <hr>
            <div>Handmade web pages flourished in the mid-to-late-1990s, in the brief period after the academic
                web and before the corporate web. ‘Handmade’ is by no means the only or best term to define
                the web of this period.</div>
                <br>
            <div>In her essay, <a target="_blank" href="http://art.teleportacia.org/observation/vernacular/">A Vernacular Web (2005)</a>, Olia Lialina describes the web of the mid-1990s as: bright, rich, personal, slow and under construction. It was a web of sudden connections and
                personal links. Pages were built on the edge of tomorrow, full of hope for a faster connection
                and a more powerful computer... it was a web of amateurs soon to be washed away by dot.com
                ambitions, professional authoring tools and guidelines designed by usability experts.

                amateur web, see: <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.geocities.institute/about">One Terabyte of Kilobyte Age: Digging through the Geocities Torrent.</a></div>
