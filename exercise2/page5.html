    <h3><em>I evoke the term 'handmade web' to suggest slowness and smallness as a forms of resistance.</em></h3>
    <hr>
    <div>In today's highly commercialised web of multinational corporations, proprietary applications, read-only devices, search algorithms, Content Management Systems, WYSIWYG editors, and digital publishers it becomes an increasingly radical act to hand-code and self-publish experimental web art and writing projects.</div>
    <br>
    <div>The more proprietary, predatory, and puerile a place the web becomes, the more committed I am to using it in poetic and intransigent ways.</div>
