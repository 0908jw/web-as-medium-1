    <h3><em>I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to make a correlation between handmade web
        pages and handmade print materials, such as zines, pamphlets, and artists books.</em></h3>
        <hr>
        <div>I made my first web-based work in 1995. The impetus for <a target="_blank" href="http://luckysoap.com/butterflies/parasite.html">Fishes & Flying Things</a> came from the
material practices of fine art and book-making. The text evolved from an installation art
exhibition I had on at the time. From this text, I created a small book-work which was meant to
tell a circular story but when people got to the end they stopped reading because that’s the way
books work. In the web version, the last page linked to the first; the story circled round and
round. Of the installation, no physical evidence remains. Of the book-work, only one copy. The
QuarkExpress file is stored on a 44 MB SyQuest cartridge which I still own, but the contents of
which I can no longer access. The handmade website, on the other hand, is still online and it still
works.</div>
<br>
<div>The handmade web emerged at a time when print and digital enjoyed a more symbiotic relationship. This is evident in the early output of the <a target="_blank" href="">trAce Online Writing Centre</a> founded at
    Nottingham Trent University in 1995. Over the next decade trAce evolved into one of the most
    influential online writing communities in the world. trAce’s first output was a <a target="_blank" href="">word-processed
    photocopied booklet</a> which contained links to websites distributing journals and zines. Fittingly,
    trAce’s last output was also a print booklet, in which it is stated:
    The trAce community embraced both camps, and some early chatlogs contain lively discussions
    about the use of mixed media in writing... The creative hypertexts and hypermedia in the trAce
    Archive can easily be compared to the multifarious pages of an artist’s book. (PDF <a target="_blank" href="">trAces: A
    Commemoration of Ten Years of Artistic Innovation at trAce</a>, page 14)
    One of the many interesting things about the <a target="_blank" href="">online archive</a> of the trAce Online Writing Centre is
    how much it reflects the context of the creation and dissemination of its contents. Whereas
    archives held in museums or libraries generally contain artifacts created elsewhere —
    manuscripts illuminated in a monastery, for example, or photographs developed in a darkroom
    — the handmade web pages contained in this online archive continue to exist in the medium
    within which they were created. That said, the frames through which we view them continue to
    change.</div>
    <br>
    <div>In "Media Archaeology: Method and Machine versus History and Narrative of Media" (2011)
        Wolfgang Ernst observes: "If a radio from a museum collection is reactivated to play broadcast
        channels of the present, it changes its status: it is not a historical object anymore but actively
        generates sensual and informational presence." Similarly, when viewing old web pages in
        
        modern browsers we are confronted with a temporal paradox. Layer upon layer of <a target="_blank" href="">dated web-
        design aesthetics</a> overlap and peel like wallpaper, revealing earlier versions beneath. Pages optimised for lower resolutions now take <a target="_blank" href="">less than a third of the screen</a>. Ghosts of browsers past
        mingle with occasional page errors, dead links, and missing images. Sound files play
        automatically. Warnings abound, issued from earlier eras, addressed to readers who are not us.</div>
        <br>
        <div>For example, M.D. Coverley’s <a 
           target="_blank" href="">The Personalization of Complexity (2001)</a> "explores the ways in
            which each of our personal computers have become idiosyncratic, individualized entities, only
            sometimes manageable by the owners." Fittingly, the piece itself warns that it is viewable only
            on Level 4 and 5 Microsoft Internet Explorer and Level 4 Netscape. Netscape 6 will not support
            many of the features in this essay.</div>
            <br>
            <div>These are not artifacts of a dead web but rather, signposts on a map of a living web pointing to a
                web as it once was, a web in progress, a web in the making.</div>
